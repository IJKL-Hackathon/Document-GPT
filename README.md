## Problem & Idea
### Problem
Students often face challenges in efficiently managing and synthesizing information from various sources during their research process. This can lead to time consuming and sometimes ineffective study practices. 

#### Feasibility
The solution involves a platform that consolidates research materials, facilitates quiz creation, and offers summarization features to simplify the research process, improve study efficiency, and enhance the overall learning experience for students. Feasibility is supported by available technology and the potential positive impact on academic performance.

### Idea
Main features:
Employ advanced semantic search for precision in document retrieval.
Automatically distill comprehensive document summaries for efficient understanding.
Generate insightful questions derived from the content of the documents.

#### Utility
The idea aims to offer significant benefits to students by providing a one-stop solution for research, study, and knowledge consolidation. It addresses common academic needs, simplifying processes such as research and exam preparation. The utility is strengthened by its alignment with the educational requirements and preferences of the target users.

#### Innovations
The idea merges different functions to meet students' academic needs uniquely. Unlike separate tools for research, quiz creation, and summarization, this innovation integrates these features into a single platform tailored for students. This consolidated approach provides a comprehensive solution, minimizing the use of multiple tools and enhancing the user experience in the digital learning landscape.
